# Secure Login: Secret Messages

In this project you will use your new knowledge of If, Elif and Else to create a Secure Login System that will provide each of your users a unique and special message to make them feel warm and fuzzy inside.

Your project must have...
- Title
- Username and Password collecting input from user
- Unique message for at least 3 people
- an "else" statement for anyone else
- This exact username, password and message for me. And I mean exact. You'll see why in the steps.

**Username:** Spackdude

**Password:** sensitivePonyTailGuy

**Message:** You are the best teacher anyone has ever had and I definitely would be saying this even if you weren't making me. I am so lucky.

  ## Steps
  1. Build your code and check it for bugs. Maybe have someone who you created a username and password for test it out for you!
  2. Run the test I created for my username and password under Tools> Tests> Spackdude to check your code.
  3. Submit!



  Example Elif Conditional
```python
favFlavor = input("Which do you prefer, chocolate, vanilla, or strawberry? ")
favVessel = input("...and how do you like to eat it, cone or cup? ")

if favFlavor == "chocolate" and favVessel == "cup":
    print("Yes, you are a god among men, destined for great things.")
elif favFlavor == "vanilla":
    print("Vanilla is fine, and whatever you eat it in does not make a difference to it's meh'ness")
else:
    print("Be gone with you! Strawberry icecream is an abomination!")

```
